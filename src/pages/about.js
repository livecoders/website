          <h3>During broadcasts, politely answer questions from viewers</h3>
          <p>
            We value education and continuous learning/improvement. We love
            members who answer questions their viewers have, explain their
            projects and even help their community members succeed.

          <h3>Promote a positive, inclusive, and welcoming chat room</h3>
          <p>
            Viewer interaction and community building is one of our core drives
            for doing what we do. With that, we make sure that any potential
            members put their community first! If you provide a welcoming,
            educational and even fun environment for your viewers, you are sure

          <h3>Are a person, not a brand or company account</h3>
          <p>
            We are a team of individuals, and while some of us work for big
            companies and brands, we still represent ourselves. We value the
            same for new members.

          <h3>Regularly write code or make things with technology</h3>
          <p>
            While we love content such as gaming, just chatting and others, our
            primary focus is development. With that, we value members who
            regularly develop projects (games, websites, apps) or combine
            hardware with technology.
