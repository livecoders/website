Hi everyone!
I'm a software engineer on the
[PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
team at Microsoft.
In addition to PowerShell itself,
I work on the Visual Studio Code extension for PowerShell,
helped ship the PowerShell experience in Azure Functions,
work on the PowerShell Jupyter kernel and more!
I'm a developer experience nut,
love coffee and love to customize mechanical keyboards.

I use C#, TypeScript, and of course, PowerShell, every day.

See what I'm up to both at work and off work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TylerLeonhardt) 🐙🐈
