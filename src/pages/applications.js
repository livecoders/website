        <h2>Why this page exists</h2>
        <p>
          After a year and a half The Live Coders has grown from the initial
          intake to 190+ members. That's almost 10 new members per month. With
          that, we want to be more open about the application process and make
          what we do more transparent to all. This makes sure you get correct
          and timely feedback on your application. We are improving the process
          continuously and this page is a step in that direction.

        <h2>Frequent Questions</h2>
        <h3>
          I haven't heard from you and my application is taking a long time.
          WHY?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We are aiming to look at applications on a 2 week cycle at this time.
          It was previously monthly and we missed some. If we don't get back to
          you please feel free to comment on your GitHub issue.
        </p>
        <h3>I meet the minimum criteria, why wasn't I accepted?</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the criteria we look into is opinion based, like "polite and
          inviting" for example. This is why we need at least two opinions on
          each application. If you don't quite hit the criteria, we are now
          inviting you to a nurture program, which give you access to team
          members and allows you to grow.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the Nurture Program</h3>
        <p>
          During the first run through of applications since Live Coders
          Conference 2, it became apparent that there were a lot of broadcasters
          in the "not quite there" category. We saw the potential and didn't
          want to flat out reject half of the applicants. Therefore the Nurture
          Program was created. This gives a slightly limited membership into the
          Live Coders as an "Intern". You are able to ask questions, get advice
          and grow your stream and community with the help of the Team.
