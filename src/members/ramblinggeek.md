Hi, my name is Wayne. I don't code for a living, I consider myself a hobbyist programmer.

I see this stream as a place where we can all learn together. If you have an idea or want help, then join in on that chat and lets discuss it and then do it.

I've been programming as a hobby since I was young, very sporadic.
