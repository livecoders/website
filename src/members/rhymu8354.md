Hello, I'm Richard, a.k.a. Rhymu!  I've been a professional software developer since 1994 and have been streaming on Twitch since June 2018.  I enjoy implementing internet and multimedia standards, often times from scratch.  For example, I've made working implementations of ARP, ICMP, IP, UDP, TCP, SMTP, HTTP, SIP, SDP, RTP, RTSP, DHCP, MP4FF, and MPEG-2 TS (this last one was really fun!)

I built my own web server, WebSocket, and game engine libraries live on Twitch.  I know and use many programming languages, but my latest obsession is Rust.  It's actually thanks to my viewers that I got into Rust in the first place.

I stream because of the benefits of social interaction.  I enjoy teaching others as well as learning from them in return.  Even if nobody is listening, the process of "Rubber Ducking" or explaining out loud what I'm doing while I work is a really great way of testing my understanding.
