I’m a jovial, proactive, test & code, code & test, get things done well, software architect, engineer, code monkey, coder, and distributed systems advocate. Some of the things I’ve enjoyed doing over the years.

* Coder: I write code, sometimes lots of code, sometimes a little code. No language is a limit, only another tool to implement solutions. I ply polyglot language paths including: C#, JavaScript, lately while learning some Go, while I’ve used Java, Erlang, Pascal, Basic, Visual Basic, C++, C, COBOL, RPG, CL and others in the past.
Founder: I’ve founded Deconstructed.io with Aaron Gray, Node PDX with Troy Howard, and .NET Fringe with a whole host of excellent people and more events are in the works.

* Messenger: Every chance I get I work to share knowledge I’ve gained over the years. Yes, I regularly have opinions and I do like to share those! From workshops, presenting, to one on one mentoring, pair programming, or directed training.

* Recon: I love seeing technologies built and technologies come together. I routinely scour the internet, engage in conversations with leaders of thoughts, and thinkers of new things, as I like to contribute where I can and am always thinking of what’s next.

Besides all that technology stuff, I dig some good coffee, great beer, wine, food and a good music show. I cycle, almost everywhere these days, don’t own a car (but I’m a car snob of the serious racing sort auto-x, tuners, drift, rally, etc), I verge on the “transit nerd” and “rail nut” category along with “plane spotter” and “exotic car driver”. I also play guitar – primarily thrashing (metal), love to prog with some Jazz, croon along with some blues, and delve into a range of musical nuances.

…and I’m sure that misses a few things, but I think it gives a good overview of where you’d usually find my mind and I.
