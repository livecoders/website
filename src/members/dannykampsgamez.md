Danny is just your Regular web/app developer that tends to do things a little differently. There is no limit to the crazy things his brain comes up with and sometimes he doesn't even know what or why he's building stuff himself. If you're up for the most random things than Danny's stream is the right stream for you. From a bot that makes sure people know how to count to building a "Gangster simulator" browser game there is really no limit.
