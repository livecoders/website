Thijs Doornbos a.k.a nopogo_tv is a Dutch developer. His streams are an adventure through the Unity game engine. He is currently co creating his debut title codenamed “die in space”. When not streaming he creates serious gaims for behavioral science. With an 8 year background in backend programming he is sometimes forced to do webdev. Will occasionally procrastinate from development with games.
