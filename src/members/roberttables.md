Hecc! I'm David Poindexter (aka roberttables). I'm currently an AWS Technical Architect leading a team of super smart people at a boutique consulting agency in Indianapolis, In.

I'm a Twitch Technology Variety Streamer. You'll find a mix of topics and projects anywhere from soldering projects to cloud application deployments. We maintain a forever-learner, chill and engaging atmosphere.

While the stream is in the "mature content" category on Twitch, you'll find a welcoming, inclusive atmosphere where no question is a stupid question. We're all here to learn.

And we Do it Live.
